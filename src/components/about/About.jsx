      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3>At a glance</h3>
      <p>I love math and computer science. I spend as much of my time learning and using them to solve real problems.
        One of my favorite things is working with a new concept and struggling through it until you can finally get the "aha" moment and really understand why it works.
        <br></br>
        For several years, I was learning these on my own, and really enjoying it, but it came time to get serious about my study.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Currently, I am a Junior in the Computer Science/Software Engineering program and Southern New Hampshire University.
        <br></br>
        I have a 3.9 GPA and completed classes include but are not limited to:
        <br></br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Intro to App Development
          </li>
          <li>
            Intro to Structured Database Environments
          </li>
          <li>
            Discrete Math
          </li>
          <li>
            Applied Statistics for STEM
          </li>
          <li>
            Applied Linear Algebra
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>And while I'm pursuing my formal education, I am constantly improving my skills through projects and books. For example, I'm brushing back up on Calculus so I can familiarize myself with gradient descent to better understand Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
        Furthermore, I have been working on the projects you can check out below. At the moment I am working on a Deep Learning course in my own time in order to craft my own model that I will integrate into my Next.js food blog.
