      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3>At a glance</h3>
      <p>With eight years in supply chain operations, I’ve developed a proven ability to navigate fast-paced, high-production environments while managing competing priorities and solving problems proactively. My customer-facing roles taught me the importance of service and professionalism, skills I now bring to my transition into technology—a field I’ve grown deeply passionate about through my love for mathematics, problem-solving, and innovation.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>After a suggestion from someone close to me, I discovered programming and quickly became captivated by the blend of technology and the exciting mathematics behind it all. This passion drives me as I juggle full-time work, full-time school, and family, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering, as well as a minor in Applied Mathematics, at Southern New Hampshire University, where I’ve maintained a 3.97 GPA as a Senior. I will be graduating in summer of 2026</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Mathematics and computer science are more than academic pursuits to me—they embody the thrill of solving complex problems and those breakthrough moments when concepts click. My academic foundation includes coursework in:
