      <h3>At a glance</h3>
      <p>Mathematics and computer science are more than academic pursuits - they represent the excitement
        of problem-solving and the thrill of those breakthrough moments when complex concepts finally click into place.
        This passion for understanding drives my excitement and commitment to continuous learning and real-world application for new skills.

      <p>Currently pursuing a Computer Science/Software Engineering degree at Southern New Hampshire
        University with a 3.96 GPA, my prior academic foundations include:
        <br></br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Application Development
          </li>
          <li>
            Structured Database Environments
          </li>
          <li>
            Discrete Math
          </li>
          <li>
            Applied Statistics for STEM
          </li>
          <li>
            Applied Linear Algebra
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Beyond formal education, my current ongoing self-directed learning focuses on advanced topics like
        Machine Learning and Neural Networks, as well as refamiliarizing myself with backend development through
        Node.js, Express, and REST APIs. Currently, I'm working on a multiplayer pong game and the Practical Deep Learning for Coders course,
        so a working deep learning model demo should be up shortly. Check back soon!
