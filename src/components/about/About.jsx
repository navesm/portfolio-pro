      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3>At a glance</h3>
      <p>With eight years in supply chain operations, I’ve developed a proven ability to navigate fast-paced, high-production environments while managing competing priorities and solving problems proactively. My customer-facing roles taught me the importance of service and professionalism, skills I now bring to my transition into technology—a field I’ve grown deeply passionate about through my love for mathematics, problem-solving, and innovation.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>After a suggestion from someone close to me, I discovered programming and quickly became captivated by the blend of technology and the exciting mathematics behind it all. This passion drives me as I juggle full-time work, full-time school, and family, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University, where I’ve maintained a 3.97 GPA as a junior.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>Mathematics and computer science are more than academic pursuits to me—they embody the thrill of solving complex problems and those breakthrough moments when concepts click. My academic foundation includes coursework in:
        <br></br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Application Development
          </li>
          <li>
            Structured Database Environments
          </li>
          <li>
            Discrete Math
          </li>
          <li>
            Applied Statistics for STEM
          </li>
          <li>
            Applied Linear Algebra
          </li>
        </ul>
        alongside self-directed exploration of advanced topics like Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and backend development using Node.js, Express, and REST APIs.

      <p>I’m currently working on a multiplayer Pong game and completing the Practical Deep Learning for Coders course, aiming to showcase a working deep learning model demo soon. My portfolio below reflects my technical skills, passion for continuous growth, and commitment to solving real-world problems while creating value for communities.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Collaborating with bright minds on impactful challenges in software engineering and machine learning excites me, and I’m eager to contribute to innovative solutions that shape the future of technology.
